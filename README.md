# PINN-Framework-for-Laminated-Plates---Boundary-Treatments-and-Data-Assistance
Based on Wang, W., &amp; Thai, H. T. (2025) 's work on energy-based PINN for laminated composite plates under transverse bending, we compare three training regimes: (i) physics-only with hard constraint, (ii) hard-BC PINN with sparse data assistance, and (iii) physics-only with soft constraints on edge values.
