# PINN-Framework-for-Laminated-Plates---Boundary-Treatments-and-Data-Assistance
Based on Wang, W., &amp; Thai, H. T. (2025) 's work on energy-based PINN for laminated composite plates under transverse bending, we compare three training regimes: (i) physics-only with hard constraint, (ii) hard-BC PINN with sparse data assistance, and (iii) physics-only with soft constraints on edge values.
Accuracy is evaluated by R2 between predicted stress fields and FEM results. The study indicates that for laminated plate bending, hard encoding of essential BCs should be preferred, and a tiny amount of data can further anchor and stabilize the solution.
